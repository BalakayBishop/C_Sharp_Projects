This project was one of the first assignments from my course

The project is intended to show how we need to format a console application that would be easy for a user

To use this project, it asks you if you would like to use pounds or kilograms for the computation
The next part is going to ask you to then enter your body weight, and then it will ask you to enter your height based on the type of weight

The final part is the output that is going to tell your BMI for your height and weight as well as the corresponding analysis (i.e. normal, overweight, etc.)
